# About

![Photo of Brett smiling at the beach](/img/about_brett.jpg)

Hi, my name is Brett. I love making screencasts about software development.
I've been building software for 15 years, and it's something I truly enjoy
doing. I've been focused on web application development using Ruby on Rails,
but I'm interested in and explore other
technologies regularly.
