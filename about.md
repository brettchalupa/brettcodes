# About

![Photo of Brett](/img/about_brett.jpg)

Hi, my name is Brett. Monoso is my portfolio of software development and
design projects. I've been building software for 10 years, and it's
something I truly enjoy doing. I've been focused on web application
development using Ruby on Rails, but I'm interested in and explore other
technologies regularly.

Monoso is my place to share development and design resources like
screencasts, blog posts, and talks. I try my best to publish a new
screencast on
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQXaIyeRqHjK9EK41b8J3yQ)
every week.

I'm currently employed and not accepting new projects.
