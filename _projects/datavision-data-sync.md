excerpt: Webhook powered product data sync tool
---

We built the DataVision Sync application that syncs product data from [GfK Etilize](http://www.etilize.com/index.htm)’s catalog to Shopify whenever a new product is added to the Shopify store’s catalog.

The application is powered by [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/), and it was built with test-driven development practices. The main problem the application addresses is fetching data from a third-party provided on an as-needed basis.
