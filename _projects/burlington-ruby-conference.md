excerpt: Annual conference in Burlington, VT for Ruby developers
---

Burlington Ruby Conference was a single-track, weekend-long gathering of around 200 Ruby programmers in Burlington, Vermont every summer.

We joined the group of organizers of the Burlington Ruby Conference during its second year, 2013. For 2013 and 2014, we were co-organizers, and in 2015 we were the main organizers.

We worked on attendee and speaker support, budgeting, building the website, creating branding, sending emails to the mailing list, [tweeting](https://twitter.com/btvrubyconf), hiring vendors, finding sponsors, [building a proposal app](https://github.com/burlingtonruby/proposals), and hosting the event.

_This project was done by Brett while doing freelance work under his own name._
