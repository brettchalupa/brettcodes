excerpt: Annual conference in Burlington, VT for Ruby developers
---

Burlington Ruby Conference was a single-track, weekend-long gathering of
around 200 Ruby programmers in Burlington, Vermont every summer.

I joined the group of organizers of the Burlington Ruby Conference
during its second year, 2013. For 2013 and 2014, I was one of the main
organizers, and in 2015 I was the sole organizer.

I worked on attendee and speaker support, budgeting, building the
website, creating branding, sending emails to the mailing list,
[tweeting](https://twitter.com/btvrubyconf), hiring vendors, finding
sponsors, [building a proposal
app](https://github.com/burlingtonruby/proposals), and hosting the event.
