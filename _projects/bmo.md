excerpt: A defunct game jam platform that hosted over a dozen game jams.
---

Over a dozen BMOs were deployed and modified for specific game
jams. Over 1000 games were submitted and are actively hosted through
BMO. BMO was my first major side project.

BMO was built with Rails, Bootstrap, and AWS S3.

Select game jams powered by BMO:

- [Adventure Time Gamemaking Frenzy](http://www.adventuretimegamejam.com/)
