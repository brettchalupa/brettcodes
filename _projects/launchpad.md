We continue to design and develop LaunchPad for Savi Learning. LaunchPad is a curriculum planner for educators centered around Project Based Learning (PBL). Our responsibilities include user interface design, developing new features, and maintaining the infrastructure and apps.

Major completed phases for the LaunchPad project have been:

- Upgrading from Ember v1 to v2
- Upgrading the API from Rails v4 to v5
- Improving the user experience of creating projects
- Improving application stability
- Adding automated tests to the codebase
- Redesigning the project dashboard

The architecture of the project consists of a back-end API built with Ruby on Rails and a front-end web application build with Ember.js.
