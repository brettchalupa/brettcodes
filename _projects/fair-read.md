excerpt: Repository of public domain books for English language learners
---

We built the application for Fair-Read, a collection of free ebooks for English language learners. Users can take a self-placement test to determine their reading level. The application then recommends books based on the results.

Our responsibilities included user interface design, developing the app, and maintaining the infrastructure.

The architecture of the project consists of Ruby on Rails for the core
application and AWS S3 for hosting the books.
