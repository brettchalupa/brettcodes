excerpt: Repository of public domain books for English language learners
---

We built the application for Fair-Read, a collection of free ebooks for English language learners. Users can take a self-placement test to determine their reading level. The application then recommends books based on the results.

Our responsibilities include user interface design, developing new features, and maintaining the infrastructure and apps.

The architecture of the project consists of Ruby on Rails and AWS S3 for
serving the books.
