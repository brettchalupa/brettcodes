excerpt: A week-long course teaching kids how to program with Ruby
---

I developed the curriculum and taught it at the [Tarrant Code
Camp](http://tiie.w3.uvm.edu/codecamp/)
and [Cabot School](http://cabotschool.org/) during two weeks in August
2013. It was focus was on building interactive programs that teach the
fundamentals of programming. The curriculum covered basic data types,
variables, arrays, user input, logic, loops, GUIs, arrays, methods, and
classes.
