excerpt: A week-long course teaching kids how to program with Ruby
---

We developed the curriculum and taught it at the [Tarrant Code
Camp](http://tiie.w3.uvm.edu/codecamp/) and [Cabot School](http://cabotschool.org/) during two weeks in August 2013. It was focused on building interactive software that teaches the fundamentals of programming with Ruby. The curriculum covered basic data types, variables, arrays, user input, logic, loops, GUIs, arrays, methods, and
classes.
