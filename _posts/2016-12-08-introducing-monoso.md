description: A blog post introducing what Monoso is and what we do.

Hi, my name is Brett. I’m pleased to introduce Monoso, a new software consulting firm focused on building web applications. I've been doing freelance work for the past nine months under my own name, and I've decided to start using a Doing Business As (DBA) to build the company as its own entity.

We do both software design and development work, primarily for the web. Our goal is to help clients build the right software and ensure it is as simple as possible with as high quality code as possible. We want what we build to last for years and not be difficult to maintain.

From a technology standpoint, our specialities are Ruby on Rails, Ember.js, front-end web dev, Wordpress, and Shopify. I have completed and maintained many projects with each of these technologies throughout the years.

The name Monoso is a made up word consisting of "mono," meaning one since the company is just me right now, and "so," the first two letters of "software."

The [blog](/blog) is going to be a place where we write about development, design, and what we learn. It'll be a place where we share the how and, importantly, the why. Alongside the blog, we'll be creating screencast tutorials that will be uploaded to our [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQXaIyeRqHjK9EK41b8J3yQ) channel. We’ll try to create one blog post or video a week.

That’s it for now. I am excited to see where this goes. Thank you for following along on this journey.
