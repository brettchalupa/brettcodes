# Hire

Are you interested in hiring us? Awesome. Here's how it works.

We value and practice transparent and regular communication. We expect
the same from you.

We usually bill hourly. Our go-to rate is $100/hr, but if you're a small
business or non-profit we drop it 25%.

Send us an email with what you have in mind, and we'll get back to you.
From there, if it's a good fit for both of us, we'll kick off the
project.
